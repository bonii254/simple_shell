Project Overview

This project aims to create a simple shell program that emulates some basic functionalities of the Unix shell. The shell supports executing commands, handling built-in commands like exit, and tokenizing input for execution.
Files

The repository consists of the following files:

    execute_entry.c: This file contains the functions responsible for executing commands and managing processes.
    exit.c: This file implements the built-in command exit, which terminates the shell.
    getline_func.c: Here, the function to read input from the user is defined.
    int_func.c: This file holds utility functions for handling integer conversions.
    main.c: The main entry point of the shell program is in this file.
    mem_man.c: Functions for memory management are implemented here.
    str_func1.c: Basic string manipulation functions are defined in this file.
    str_func2.c: Additional string functions can be found here.
    switch_builtin.c: This file contains the switch case for handling built-in commands.
    tokenize.c: Functions to tokenize user input into command and arguments are defined in this file.
